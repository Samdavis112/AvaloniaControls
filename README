Avalonia Controls
=================
This repository contains some reusable controls for use within my other projects.  
It will be updated without warning, and will not provide backwards combatibility.   
If you like how things are in a version, DOWNLOAD THE CODE. I may change it and will  
not provide old versions. (Unless you're willing to crawl through the commits yourself!)  

Contents
--------
- **MessageBox:** designed like the windows forms message box, with selectable buttons,
customisable title and text. There is also an option to provide a textbox to accept user
input.

- **MediaPlayer:** a user control with an embedded LibVLCSharp control with seek, volume
play/pause controls. The actual mediaplayer class is not exposed, rather you use the methods
provided in the class to more simply control the player.
